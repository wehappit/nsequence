# NSequence

NSequence is a Python library designed for handling progressions or sequences, offering various functions and utilities for working with sequences. It allows users to define sequences through functional expressions, offering capabilities for various computations.


## Key Features

- **Versatile Sequence Handling**: NSequence supports a wide range of sequence types, including linear, quadratic, cubic, and more. It accommodates both direct and inverse calculations.

- **Error Handling**: The library includes robust error handling for scenarios such as arity mismatches, unexpected positions or indices, inversion errors, and index not found situations.

- **Inverse Functionality**: For invertible sequences, NSequence facilitates finding the index of a given term and vice versa. It provides options for different inversion techniques to suit your specific use case.

- **Nearest Term Search**: NSequence allows you to find the index of the nearest term to a given value in the sequence. It provides flexibility in handling tie-breakers and preferences.

## Key Methods Presentation

### Constructor

The constructor in its raw form.

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    *,
    func: Callable[[int], number],
    inverse_func: Callable[[number], number] = None,
    indexing_func: Callable[[int], int] = None,
    indexing_inverse_func: Callable[[number], number] = None,
    initial_index: int = None,
) -> None:

```
#### Parameters

- `func`: The primary function defining the sequence. This function must accept an integer position and return the corresponding sequence term.

- `inverse_func`: An optional inverse function for `func`, allowing for the computation of positions or indices based on sequence term values.

- `indexing_func`: An optional function that maps sequence positions to custom indices, enabling non-standard indexing schemes.

- `indexing_inverse_func`: The inverse of `indexing_func`, allowing for the determination of sequence positions from indices.

- `initial_index`: The starting index for the sequence. This parameter is ignored if `indexing_func` is provided, as the initial index will then be derived from the indexing function.

## nth_term
Returns the sequence term at the given position
```python
nth_term(position: int) -> number
```

#### Parameters
- `position`: Position in the sequence to calculate the term for.

### Returns
- A sequence term corresponding to the provided position.

### Example
```python
sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x**2)
print(sequence.nth_term(4))  # Output: 16
```

## position_of_index
Determines the sequence position of a given index, useful when custom indexing is used.
```python
position_of_index(index: int) -> int
```

#### Parameters
- `index`: The index for which to find the corresponding sequence position.

### Returns
- The position in the sequence that corresponds to the given index.

### Example
```python
sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x**2, indexing_func=lambda x: x + 100)
print(sequence.position_of_index(104))  # Output: 5
```

## count_terms_between_indices
Counts the number of terms between two indices in the sequence.
```python
count_terms_between_indices(index1: int, index2: int) -> int
```

#### Parameters
- `index1`: The starting index.
- `index2`: The ending index.

### Returns
- The number of terms between the two provided indices, inclusive.

### Example
```python
sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x + 1)
print(sequence.count_terms_between_indices(1, 5))  # Output: 5
```

## nearest_entry
Finds the nearest sequence entry (both the index and the term) to a given term.
```python
nearest_entry(
    term_neighbor: float,
    inversion_technic: bool = True,
    starting_position: int = 1,
    iter_limit: int = 1000,
    prefer_left_term: bool = True,
) -> tuple[int, number]
```

#### Parameters
- `term_neighbor`: The term to find the nearest sequence entry for.
- `inversion_technic`: Whether to use the inversion technique for finding the nearest term.
- `starting_position`: The starting position for the iterative search (ignored if `inversion_technic` is True).
- `iter_limit`: The maximum number of iterations for the search (ignored if `inversion_technic` is True).
- `prefer_left_term`: Preference for the left term in case of equidistant terms.

### Returns
- A tuple containing the index of the nearest term in the sequence and the term itself.

### Example
```python
sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x**2)
index, term = sequence.nearest_entry(10)
print(f"Index: {index}, Term: {term}")  # Output might vary based on the sequence definition
```

## terms_between_terms
Returns a list of sequence terms located between two given terms, inclusive.
```python
terms_between_terms(term1: float, term2: float) -> List[number]
```

#### Parameters
- `term1`: The first term.
- `term2`: The second term.

### Returns
- A list of terms in the sequence that fall between `term1` and `term2`, inclusive.

### Example
```python
sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x)
print(sequence.terms_between_terms(1, 5))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


## Real-world Examples

### Linear Sequence

```python
# Create a linear sequence: f(x) = 2x + 3
linear_sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: 2 * x + 3)

# Compute the 5th term
term_5 = linear_sequence.nth_term(5)

# Find the index of the term 13
index_of_13 = linear_sequence.index_of_term(13)

# Calculate the sum of the first 10 terms
sum_first_10_terms = linear_sequence.sum_up_to_nth_term(10)
```

### Quadratic Sequence

```python
# Create a quadratic sequence: f(x) = x^2 + 3
quadratic_sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x ** 2 + 3)

# Get the nearest term to 20
nearest_term_to_20 = quadratic_sequence.nearest_term(20)

# Count the terms between 10 and 50
count_terms_between_10_and_50 = quadratic_sequence.count_terms_between_terms(10, 50)
```

### Invertible Sequence

```python
# Create an invertible sequence with inverse function
invertible_sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: 2 * x, inverse_func=lambda y: y / 2)

# Find the index of the term 8
index_of_8 = invertible_sequence.index_of_term(8)

# Compute the terms between indices 5 and 10
terms_between_5_and_10 = invertible_sequence.terms_between_indices(5, 10)
```

## Installation

You can install NSequence using pip:

```bash
pip install nsequence
```

## Getting Started

```python
from NSequence import NSequence

# Create your sequence
my_sequence = NSequence(func=lambda x: x * 2)

# Use the sequence functionalities
term_3 = my_sequence.nth_term(3)
sum_first_5_terms = my_sequence.sum_up_to_nth_term(5)
```
